    Your mission… to Capture the Frog starts now! Each planet is a question relating to a JFrog developer tool and varies in difficulty. If you get stumped head to the Hackergarten and ask one of our Frogs for a hint. As an added layer of fun we have included our sponsors in the game. Head to their booths to get the answers to their questions - Google won’t help!
    <p> Good Luck! </p>
